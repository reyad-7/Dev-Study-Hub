# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
We can say that when we have Parent-Child relationships, i.e., Inheritance Relationships between two classes,
then if we successfully replace the object/instance of a parent class with an object/instance of the child class without affecting the behavior of the base class instance,
it is said to be in Liskov Substitution Principle.
If you are not getting this point properly, donâ€™t worry; we will see some real-time examples to understand this concept.
