##  What are SOLID Principles?

**SOLID** is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:

- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O**: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Each principle is explained in detail in its dedicated Markdown file.
